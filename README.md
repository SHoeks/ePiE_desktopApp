# ePiE_desktopApp
ePiE is a spatially explicit model that estimates concentrations of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in surface waters across Europe. Based on relatively few data entries such as national consumption data, compound properties and environmental fate parameters, ePiE estimates average pharmaceutical concentrations in river catchments. This application was developed by Selwyn Hoeks at Radboud University supported by the PRIMIER project to facilitate the use of the ePiE model.
