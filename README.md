# ePiE_desktopApp
This repository hosts the graphical user interface for the ePiE model. ePiE is a spatially explicit model that estimates concentrations of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in surface waters across Europe. Based on relatively few data entries such as national consumption data, compound properties and environmental fate parameters, ePiE estimates average pharmaceutical concentrations in river catchments. This application was developed by Selwyn Hoeks at Radboud University supported by the PREMIER project to facilitate the use of the ePiE model.
